                  prize money pool of such League, which will be passed on to
                  the winner(s) of the League after the completion of the League
                  as per the terms and conditions of such League. The amount to
                  be paid-in by you towards the prize money pool would also be
                  debited from your Account Balance maintained with HalaPlay.

                  number of actual entries in the League. Halaplay may also, at

                  tournaments irrespective of the number of entries. HalaPlay

                  Some scenarios to illustrate the impact of the new TDS rules
                  are provided below:
                </Text>
                <Text gutterBottom paragraph>
                  Scenario 1: If Net winnings are less than or zero, then TDS is
                  not applicable
                </Text>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Total withdrawal in the financial year till date (A) = ₹
                    10,000 [₹ 8,000 already withdrawn + ₹ 2,000 requested today]
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Total deposits made in the financial year till date (B) = ₹
                    8,000
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Balance in user account at the beginning of current
                    financial year (C) = ₹ 2,000
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Withdrawals on which TDS has already been deducted in the
                    current financial year (D) = ₹ 0
                  </li>
                  <li>Net Winnings = A - B – C – D = ₹ 0</li>
                  <li>Withdrawal requested= ₹ 2,000</li>
                  <li>Amount credited to your bank account = ₹ 2,000</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <Text />
              <Text gutterBottom paragraph>
                In this scenario your net winnings are 0, so TDS is not
                applicable on your withdrawal.
              </Text>
              <Text gutterBottom paragraph>
                Scenario 2: If Net winnings are greater than zero, then TDS is
                applicable.
              </Text>
              <Text gutterBottom paragraph>
                Example:
              </Text>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Total withdrawal in the financial year till date (A) = ₹
                  38,000 [₹ 26,000 already withdrawn + ₹ 12,000 requested today]
                </li>
                <li>
                  Total deposits made in the financial year till date (B) = ₹
                  15,000
                </li>
                <li>
                  Balance in user account at the beginning of current financial
                  year (C) = ₹ 15,000
                </li>
                <li>
                  Withdrawals on which TDS has already been deducted in the
                  current financial year (D) = ₹ 1000
                </li>
                <li>Net Winnings = A - B – C – D = ₹ 7,000</li>
                <li>Withdrawal requested= ₹12,000</li>
                <li>TDS deducted = 30% x Net Winnings = ₹2,100</li>
                <li>Amount credited to your bank account = ₹ 9,900</li>
              </ul>
              <Text gutterBottom paragraph></Text>
              <Text gutterBottom paragraph>
                In this scenario your net winnings is ₹ 7,000, which is greater
                than 0, so TDS of ₹ 2,100 is deducted from your requested
                withdrawal and ₹ 9,900 is credited to your bank account.
              </Text>
              <Text gutterBottom paragraph>
                Scenario 3: TDS was deducted on net winnings during the
                financial year, however, net winnings have reduced since
